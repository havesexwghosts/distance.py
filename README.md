# Selenium-Based Application for Distance Calculation | Distance.py

## Key Features:
- **Pandas** reads and processes the addresses from the columns "Origem" and "Destino".
- **Selenium** automates the web search for the shortest distance between the two addresses.
- The results are saved in a new **Excel (.xlsx)** file, with the calculated distances placed in the "Result" column.
- The output file is automatically named with the current time in the format `HH.MM.SS`.

## User Interface:
A simple **CustomTkinter** GUI allows you to interact with the application seamlessly and input the necessary details.
